mlrV2.2 Plugins

Currently there is only a single plugin.  This is a demo app showing how to control both bpm and volume of mlrV2.2 utilizing pattr objects and the broken out pattrmarker added to the serialosc edition of mlrV2.2

If you are not using the serialosc edition of mlrV2.2 you can place the _mlrV_nermod.maxpat in your mlrv2.2 folder, and open it instead of the generic _mlrV.maxpat in order to use the plugins.

Thanks to flyingoctopus for adding the arc objects

These plug-ins require the OSC-Route object that can be found in the CNMAT Everything collection:
