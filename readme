mlrV2.2 Plugins

Currently there is only a single plugin.  This is a demo app showing how to control both bpm and volume of mlrV2.2 utilizing pattr objects and the broken out pattrmarker added to the serialosc edition of mlrV2.2

This will be updated fairly soon with new plug in concepts, specifically a series of apps designed to interface the arc with mlrV2.2
